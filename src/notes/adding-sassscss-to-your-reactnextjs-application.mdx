### What is SASS?

SASS short for **S**yntactically **A**wesome **S**tyle**S**heet (Yes, as the name suggests, it's really awesome), it is just CSS but better (Basically you can say SASS is CSS on steroids!). It is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets

### Why SASS?

SASS has few options which aren't offered by CSS. Few of them are

1. **Variables:** With SASS, you can save information in variables to be used again later. So it’s possible, for example, to centrally store a colour value under a catchier variable.
2. **Mathematical functions:** In SASS, you can also use mathematical operations like +, -, \*, /, or %. This allows you to influence size specifications.
3. **Functions:** Other functions also make it easier to work on the design. These allow you to modify colour values or analyze lists, among other things.
4. **Mixins:** Mixins, simply said, are templates. You can either create them yourself or simply integrate them into your own code when using a framework.

There are many more amazing features offered by Sass.

### Syntax

Sass includes two syntax options:

1. **SCSS (Sassy CSS):** Using the `.scss` file extension and is fully adjective with CSS syntax
2. **Indented (simply called ‘Sass’):** using `.sass` file extension and indentation rather than brackets; it is not fully adjective with CSS syntax, but it’s quicker to write.

### Adding it to your React Application

Adding it to CRA app and NextJS app is a bit different, I will explain how you can add it to both the applications.

#### Adding SASS/SCSS to NextJS Application

It is a straightforward process, you just have to install the `sass` package and you are good to go!

```
// using npm
npm i sass

// using yarn
yarn add sass
```

#### Adding SASS/SCSS to CRA Application

React-scripts uses `sass-loader v8`, which prefers node-sass to sass (which has some syntax not supported by node-sass). So we would be using that package instead

```
// using npm
npm i node-sass@4.14

// using yarn
yarn add node-sass@4.14
```

Version 4.14 is preferred over the latest version of node-sass because it would throw an error. Or you could refer the below image and install the node-sass version according to your Node version!

After installing the `node-sass/sass` package now you just have to rename the .css file extension to sass or scss and change the imports, that's it! You have added the sass/scss to your react application.

I hope this blog post helped you guys.
