title: Difference between call(), apply() and bind()
publishedAt: 2025-06-21
summary: The key differences between JavaScript's call(), apply(), and bind() methods. When and how to use each method for function invocation and context binding
---

- Both `call` and `apply` methods serve the same purpose(are functionally identical) - they set the `this` context for a function and then execute it.
- The `bind` method just sets the `this` context for a function. We would need to invoke the function separately. 

> Key difference between `call` and `apply` method is that, the `call` method accepts arguments as individual parameters(i.e., a list of parameters), while `apply` accepts arguments as a single array

## call()
```ts
function test(...arguments) {
    console.log(this.foo, ...arguments); // bar 10 20
}

test.call({ foo: 'bar' }, 10, 20);
```

## apply()
```ts
function test(...arguments) {
    console.log(this.foo, arguments); // bar 10 20
}

test.apply({ foo: 'bar' }, 10, 20);
```

## bind()
```ts
function test(...arguments) {
    console.log(this.foo, ...arguments); // bar 10 20
}

const bindedFn = test.bind({ foo: 'bar' }, 10, 20);
bindedFn();
```
