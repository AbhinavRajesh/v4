There are quite a many centralized Q&A platforms today, but they present a problem that they
are completey owned and controlled by a centralized entity. This results in users not having
been able to take complete ownership or credit for their content. Moreover people would also
find it difficult to receive reliable answers for questions pertaining to some less popular
topics. Decentralization helps overcome this issue and builds a secure, completely transparent
and trustless platform.

CryptoStack is a blockchain-based platform which can be utilised to ask all kinds of question
in various domains and receive answers from the community. Platform users can post questions,
answer questions and receive rewards for their contributions.

It uses an incentivization strategy to uphold the quality of content and the presence of gas fees
will ward off spammers.

Each user is eligible to receive points for the answers that they post in the forum. It encourage
other users to respond with better quality of answers and also enhances the usefulness of the
platform. These points accumulate over time, building the user reputation. If a particular answer is accepted
by the user who had asked the question, the user who answered will receive 0.01 CELO tokens as a mark
of appreciation.

CryptoStack also has an NFT Marketplace. This is intended to be support revenue generation on
platform so that rewards can be paid out to the contributors. Each NFT costs 0.1 CELO to mint,
for regular users while frequent contributors are eligible to receive discounts on NFT purchases.
The entire proceeds from sales goes to reward distribution for the platform users.
